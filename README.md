# hello-world

It's 12:52pm. On a bus, going North. I hope I don't loose my head on this Greyhound (it's a good think I am not on a Greyhound). I packed a slice of my mom's killer fruit cake. It has been soaking in brandy so long it makes the backs of your jaws tingle. I packed it to remind myself I'm on the move now.
